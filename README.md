The main goal of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of crime distribtion in Chicago, using data from [cityofchicago.org](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data) and how the frequency of specific crimes have changed over time. I'll be addressing the year over year change in crime occurance starting with data from 2002 up until 2022, along with looking into the seasonality, or lack thereof, for crimes. Beyond that I'll also be using S/ARIMA and other models to forecast potential crime rates using a varying range of data to assist in visualizing the change in crime rates. Additionally exploring individual districts in Chicago to examine which crimes have disproportionally higher arrest rates along with higher a rate of occurance. I used Jupyter Notebook along with a number of python libraries to assist my progress. Some of the libraries used are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, pmdarima, and statsmodels.
